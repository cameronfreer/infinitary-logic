# Infinitary Logic in Lean 4

![CI](https://github.com/cameronfreer/infinitary-logic/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

A Lean 4 formalization of infinitary logic (L∞ω and Lω₁ω), Scott sentences, and classical results in infinitary model theory, building on [Mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/).

- **[Project page](https://cameronfreer.github.io/infinitary-logic/)**
- **[Blueprint (web)](https://cameronfreer.github.io/infinitary-logic/blueprint/)** · **[Blueprint (pdf)](https://cameronfreer.github.io/infinitary-logic/blueprint/blueprint.pdf)**
- **[API docs](https://cameronfreer.github.io/infinitary-logic/docs/)** · **[Dependency graph](https://cameronfreer.github.io/infinitary-logic/blueprint/dep_graph_document.html)**

## Main Results

- **Scott sentences** — Every countable structure in a countable relational language has a Scott sentence characterizing it up to isomorphism among countable structures.
- **Scott rank < ω₁** — The Scott rank of any countable structure is a countable ordinal.
- **Karp's theorem** — Back-and-forth equivalence at all ordinals characterizes L∞ω elementary equivalence.
- **Model existence** — Every countable consistent set of Lω₁ω sentences in a countable language has a countable model (Henkin-style construction, omitting types, Karp completeness).

## Scope and Boundaries

The formalization currently covers L∞ω and Lω₁ω syntax and semantics, Scott analysis (atomic diagrams, back-and-forth equivalence, Scott formulas/sentences, height and rank), Karp's theorem and corollaries, model existence via consistency properties, downward Löwenheim–Skolem for Lω₁ω, Hanf numbers, admissible-fragment results (Barwise compactness, Nadel bound), descriptive set theory of the space of countable structures (Borel complexity of satisfaction, BF-equivalence, and isomorphism; counting dichotomy), and the Silver–Burgess dichotomy for equivalence relations (splitting lemma, Cantor scheme, Silver's theorem for closed relations).

Some results carry explicit hypotheses packaging external content not yet formalized: `morley_hanf_of_transfer` is conditional on `MorleyHanfTransfer` (Erdős–Rado / Ehrenfeucht–Mostowski machinery). The Silver–Burgess dichotomy (`silverBurgessDichotomy`) is proved modulo 1 sorry in `borel_to_closed_reduction` (in `GandyHarrington.lean`), which requires Gandy–Harrington topology not yet in Mathlib; `morley_counting` chains through this.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cameronfreer/infinitary-logic.git && cd infinitary-logic
lake build
```

To use in your own project, add the dependency to your `lakefile` and import a bundle:

```lean
import InfinitaryLogic.Core         -- syntax, semantics, Scott, Karp
import InfinitaryLogic.Countable    -- model existence, LS, Hanf, EM chain
import InfinitaryLogic.Admissible   -- admissible fragments, Barwise compactness
import InfinitaryLogic.Descriptive  -- descriptive set theory of model classes
import InfinitaryLogic.Conditional  -- results with external hypotheses or sorries
import InfinitaryLogic.All          -- everything
```

`import InfinitaryLogic` also loads everything. `InfinitaryLogic/Basic.lean` is a deprecated redirect to `All`.

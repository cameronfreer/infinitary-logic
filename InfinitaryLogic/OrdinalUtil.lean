# Small ordinal facts

Neutral helpers about countable ordinals, used by the Scott refinement count, the Borel
`BFEquiv` analysis, and the ranked-thinness package. Nothing here is specific to infinitary
logic, descriptive set theory, or any one of those consumers.

Both shapes of the countability statement are provided: `Set.Countable (Set.Iio β)` and the
`Countable` *instance* on the coercion, since consumers need one or the other and converting
at each site is noise.

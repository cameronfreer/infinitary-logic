# Silver via the classical category route (Miller): interface layer

This file scaffolds the chosen route to `gandy_harrington_for_relation` (the project's one
remaining sorry): Benjamin Miller's classical, forcing-free, effective-DST-free proof of
Silver's theorem ["The graph-theoretic approach to descriptive set theory", BSL 18(4), 2012,
Theorem 11; also "Forceless, ineffective, powerless proofs of descriptive dichotomy theorems,
Lecture I"]. The proof composes:

1. **KST `G₀`-dichotomy** (classical proof via the σ-ideal of Borel `G`-independent sets):
   for the graph `G = ¬E` off the diagonal, either there is a Borel ℵ₀-coloring — giving
   countably many classes — or a continuous homomorphism `φ : 2^ℕ → α` from `G_S(2^ℕ)` to `G`.
2. **Pullback + Kuratowski–Ulam**: every class of `E' = (φ × φ)⁻¹(E)` is `G_S`-independent,
   hence meager (for dense `S`); Kuratowski–Ulam then makes `E'` itself meager.
3. **Mycielski**: a meager equivalence relation on Cantor space admits a continuous map
   `ψ : 2^ℕ → 2^ℕ` with distinct points inequivalent.
4. `f = φ ∘ ψ` is the desired perfect antichain.

Steps 1–2 are packaged here as `CategoryReductionHypothesis`, step 3 as
`MycielskiCantorHypothesis`, and step 4 is **proved**: `gandy_harrington_of_category_route`
derives the exact statement of `gandy_harrington_for_relation` from the two hypotheses.

## Design note (audit outcome)

An earlier candidate design — a Gandy–Harrington-style forcing layer
(`Cond`/`split`/`fusion` on subsets of `α`) feeding `CantorScheme.exists_antichain_map` — does
NOT match this route: in Miller's proof the forcing-style largeness lives on spaces of finite
partial homomorphisms `2^n → α` (the `I_n`-positive sets inside the classical `G₀`-dichotomy
proof), not on subsets of `α`, and the final antichain is a composite `φ ∘ ψ` rather than the
limit of a scheme on `α`. Sibling cross-avoidance at finite stages is impossible for dense
relations (e.g. the pullback of `E₀`), so `exists_antichain_map` is *not* the assembly point
for this route; it remains the assembly point for the closed case (`silver_core_closed`).

## Frontier decomposition (all classical; no effective DST)

* `MycielskiCantorHypothesis` — **PROVED** (`mycielskiCantorHypothesis_holds`, via
  `mycielski_cantor` in `InfinitaryLogic/Descriptive/Mycielski.lean`). The assembly
  `gandy_harrington_of_categoryReduction` therefore needs only the remaining hypothesis.
* `CategoryReductionHypothesis` — decomposes further into: Kuratowski–Ulam — **PROVED**
  (`isMeagre_of_isMeagre_sections` in `InfinitaryLogic/Descriptive/KuratowskiUlam.lean`,
  with the section lemmas `residual_isNowhereDense_section` / `residual_isMeagre_section`);
  the `G_S(2^ℕ)` graphs with the dense-`S` independence lemma — **PROVED**
  (`exists_gSGraph_edge_of_not_isMeagre` and the deliverable
  `isMeagre_pullback_class_of_gSGraph_hom` in `InfinitaryLogic/Descriptive/GSGraph.lean`);
  and the classical `G₀`-dichotomy (Miller's proof of KST via `I_n`-positive sets of
  partial homomorphisms; the hard core — the only remaining piece). Producing a continuous
  homomorphism `φ` from `G_S` (some dense, sparse `S`) to `¬r` and feeding it to
  `isMeagre_pullback_class_of_gSGraph_hom` + `isMeagre_of_isMeagre_sections` discharges
  `CategoryReductionHypothesis`.

/-- **Mycielski's theorem for Cantor space** (hypothesis form). A meager equivalence relation
on `ℕ → Bool` admits a continuous map of Cantor space into it with distinct points pairwise
inequivalent. Classical content: Kechris, CDST 19.1 (specialized); provable by a Cantor scheme
of basic clopen boxes avoiding, at level `n`, the first `n` nowhere dense closed sets covering
the relation. Injectivity is omitted: it follows from the antichain property and reflexivity
(see `gandy_harrington_of_category_route`). -/

      ∀ a b : ℕ → Bool, a ≠ b → ¬ E.r (ψ a) (ψ b)

/-- **Category reduction** (hypothesis form): a Borel equivalence relation with uncountably
many classes on a Polish space admits a continuous `φ : 2^ℕ → α` whose pullback relation is
meager. This packages steps 1–2 of Miller's classical proof of Silver's theorem: the
`G₀`-dichotomy applied to the complement graph `¬r` (the coloring side is impossible with
uncountably many classes), followed by `G_S`-independence of the pullback classes and
Kuratowski–Ulam. -/

/-- **Assembly of the category route** (proved): the two hypotheses above compose to give
exactly the statement of `gandy_harrington_for_relation`. Pull `r` back along `φ` to a meager
equivalence relation on Cantor space, apply Mycielski to get `ψ`, and take `f = φ ∘ ψ`;
injectivity follows from the antichain property and reflexivity of `r`. -/

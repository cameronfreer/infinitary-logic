# Satisfaction of Lω₁ω Formulas is Borel

This file proves that for a countable relational language L, the set of codes in
`StructureSpace L` satisfying a given Lω₁ω sentence is measurable (Borel).

## Main Definitions

- `ModelsOfBounded`: The set of codes where a bounded formula is realized.
- `ModelsOf`: The set of codes where a sentence is realized.

## Main Results

- `modelsOfBounded_measurableSet`: Satisfaction of any bounded Lω₁ω formula is measurable.
- `modelsOf_measurableSet`: Satisfaction of any Lω₁ω sentence is measurable.

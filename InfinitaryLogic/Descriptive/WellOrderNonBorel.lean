# Non-Borelness of the countable well-order class (issue #33)

The descriptive-set-theoretic payoff of Marker's boundedness theorem: the class **WO** of
countable well-orders is **not Borel** as a subset of the logic space.

```
theorem wellOrderClass_not_measurableSet (lt : L.Relations 2) : ¬ MeasurableSet (wellOrderClass lt)
```

Were it Borel, López–Escobar (#10) would give a sentence `φ` with `ModelsOf φ = WO` — but only
over **coded** structures, whose carrier is `ℕ`.  The bridge from there to arbitrary models is
the fragment-elementary substructure machinery (#13), applied to `φ ⊓ infiniteAxiom` so that
finite models cannot escape:

* `exists_countable_defect_seed` — a structure whose distinguished relation is not a well-order
  carries a **countable nonempty seed** of witnesses (a trichotomy or transitivity failure, or
  the range of an infinite descending sequence) whose presence forces the same failure in every
  subset containing it;
* `isWellOrder_of_realize` — hence every model of `φ ⊓ infiniteAxiom` is well-ordered: seed a
  countable fragment-elementary substructure with the defect, transport it to the carrier `ℕ`,
  and the resulting code would be a member of `ModelsOf φ = WO` that is not a well-order.

Marker's Corollary 4.27 then bounds the order types of all models of `φ ⊓ infiniteAxiom` by a
single countable ordinal, which `exists_code_type_eq` contradicts.

  (statement := /-- Over a countable relational vocabulary with a distinguished binary
    relation, the class of codes whose relation well-orders the carrier is **not** Borel in the
    logic space. -/)
  (proof := /-- If it were Borel, López--Escobar would present it as $\mathrm{ModelsOf}\
    \varphi$ — but only over coded structures, whose carrier is $\mathbb{N}$.  Conjoin the
    $\Lomegaone$ infiniteness axiom, so that no finite model escapes, and let $M$ be any model
    of the conjunction whose relation is not a well-order.  A well-order here is trichotomy
    plus well-foundedness, so the failure is witnessed either by two incomparable unequal
    elements or by an infinite descending chain; seed a countable fragment-elementary
    substructure with those witnesses and the failure survives, while the added conjunct keeps
    the substructure infinite, so it transports to a code lying in the class without being a
    well-order — a contradiction.  Hence every model of the conjunction is well-ordered, and
    Marker's Corollary 4.27 bounds all their order types by one countable $\alpha$; the
    comparison structure of type $\alpha + \omega$ transported to $\mathbb{N}$ is a code of the
    class exceeding that bound. -/)

# Hanf Numbers

This file defines Hanf numbers for Lω₁ω sentences and states the fundamental
existence theorem and the Morley-Hanf bound.

## Main Definitions

- `HasArbLargeModels`: A sentence has arbitrarily large models.
- `IsHanfBound`: A cardinal κ is a Hanf bound for a sentence φ if having a model
  of size ≥ κ implies having arbitrarily large models.
- `HanfNumber`: The least Hanf bound for a sentence.

## Main Results

- `hanf_existence`: Every Lω₁ω sentence has a Hanf number.
- The universal property of `HanfNumber`: `hanfNumber_isHanfBound`,
  `hanfNumber_le_of_isHanfBound`, `hanfNumber_le_iff_isHanfBound`, `IsHanfBound.mono`.

The Morley-Hanf bound itself — `morley_hanf : IsHanfBound φ (ℶ_ω₁)`, unconditional over an
arbitrary language — is proved in `Conditional/MorleyHanfSchemaDischarge.lean` and exposed
(with its `HanfNumber` corollaries) through `ModelTheory/MorleyHanf.lean`.

# The local EM extraction bridge

The **extraction bridge** of the `EMContext` re-base over the countable `localColim s₀`:
instantiating the proved tail extraction (`morleyHanfExtractionTail_holds`) at the countable
local family `ΓEMlocal` — via its enumeration `exists_ΓEMlocalEnum` — yields, inside any source
model of size `≥ ℶ_{ω₁}` (the honest Morley–Hanf premise), a pairwise-distinct sequence that is
tail-indiscernible on the *whole* family. This is exactly the `hind` + distinctness data of the
future local `EMContext`; its `atom_mem`/`rel_mem`/deForm-closure obligations are already
discharged by the `ΓEMlocal` membership interface (`locDeEqAtom_mem_ΓEMlocal` etc. in
`LocalEMFamily.lean`). What could not even be *stated* usefully over the uncountable
`skolemColim` atom diagram is here a two-line composition — the payoff of the whole L_Γ pivot.

This file holds the extraction bridge together with the concrete-context assembly
`exists_localEMContext` (which builds an actual `LocalEMContext` from the bridge + the `ΓEMlocal`
membership dischargers). It is isolated from the rest of the local stack because of its import: it
consumes `Conditional/MorleyHanfTransfer.lean` — a deliberate, temporary inversion of the
Core→Methods→Conditional axis. The consumed theorem `morleyHanfExtractionTail_holds` is *proved*
(sorry-free, axiom-clean), not a conditional hypothesis; with the Morley–Hanf endpoint now on
the default surface (`ModelTheory/MorleyHanf.lean`), `Conditional/` is a historical directory
name and this inversion is harmless. The local context machinery itself
(deep interpretation, realize bridges, quotient, structure, truth lemma) lives in the pure
`LocalEMContext.lean`, which imports only the Methods-side local stack.

/-- **The concrete local EM context**: inside any `s₀.Lang`-structure `M` of size `≥ ℶ_{ω₁}`, the
extraction bridge assembles an actual `LocalEMContext` over the countable colimit language
`localColim s₀` on the ambient carrier `M` (structured by `localColimStructure s₀`). Its `hind` comes
from `exists_ΓEMlocal_tail_indiscernible`; its `atom_mem`/`rel_mem` are the `ΓEMlocal` membership
dischargers. The family `ctx.Γ = ΓEMlocal s₀` and the pairwise-distinctness of the deep sequence
`ctx.a` are exposed as explicit conjuncts — the family is fixed for the downstream deForm/truth-lemma
work, and distinctness feeds the later cardinality / skeleton-injection argument. -/

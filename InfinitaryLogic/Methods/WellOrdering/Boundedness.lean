# Boundedness of well-founded models (issue #12, step 6 layer 2)

Marker Corollary 4.27 in relational/countable form, via the step-5 theorem contrapositively:

* `wellFounded_boundedness_relational` — if every model of `φ` interprets `lt` as a
  well-founded relation, then some countable ordinal `α` chains into **no** model of `φ`:
  the step-5 relation-preserving map would otherwise contradict well-foundedness (layer 1).
* `wellOrder_type_boundedness_relational` — if every model of `φ` interprets `lt` as a
  well-**order**, the same `α` uniformly bounds the order types: an order type `≥ α` would
  re-embed the missing `α`-chain (`Ordinal.type_le_iff'` on `Ordinal.type_toType`).

Only the raw positive forms are consumed (`RelChain`, `RelPreserving`) — no injectivity is
needed anywhere: well-foundedness kills the descending sequence directly.

/-- **Boundedness, well-founded form** (relational/countable): if every model of `φ`
interprets `lt` as a well-founded relation, then some countable ordinal `α` admits an
`lt`-chain in no model of `φ`.  Contrapositive of the step-5 theorem: were every `α < ω₁`
realized by a chain, some model of `φ` would carry a relation-preserving map from `ℚ`,
contradicting well-foundedness through the descending negative rationals. -/

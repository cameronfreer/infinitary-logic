# Local (family-restricted) Skolem language `localSkolem`

The full Skolem language `skolem₁ω L` adjoins a function symbol for **every** `L_{ω₁ω}` formula, so
it is **uncountable** (`BoundedFormulaω` is uncountable). That makes the colimit `skolemColim L` and
its de-substituted atom diagram uncountable, which is fatal for the Ehrenfeucht–Mostowski term model:
the extracted tail-indiscernible family `Γ` would have to be uncountable, but the cheap infinite-Ramsey
extraction (`MorleyHanfExtractionTail`) only produces indiscernibility over a **countable** family.

The fix is to Skolemize only a **countable family** `Γ` of formulas. `localSkolem L Γ` adjoins one
arity-`n` function symbol per `(n+1)`-ary formula *in `Γ`*. When `Γ` is countable, `localSkolem L Γ`
is countable — the first ingredient of the countable local Skolem tower `Llocal`/`Γlocal` that will
re-base the EM term model (keeping `skolemColim` as exploratory infrastructure).

This file builds the language, its Hilbert-choice structure, and its countability. The mutually
recursive language/closure tower is a later chunk.

/-- The **local Skolem language** over a family `Γ` of `L`-formulas: an arity-`n` function symbol for
each `(n+1)`-ary formula **that lies in `Γ`** (witnessing its last existential), and no relation
symbols. Unlike `skolem₁ω L` (which Skolemizes *all* formulas and is uncountable), this stays
countable whenever `Γ` is. -/

/-- The **local Skolem structure** on `M`: each symbol (a formula `φ` of `Γ`) is interpreted as a
Hilbert-choice witness for `∃ xₙ, φ`, exactly as in `skolem₁ωStructure` but only for the symbols of
the restricted family. -/

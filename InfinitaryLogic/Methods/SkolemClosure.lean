# Staged set-closure (generic core for the Skolem-closed family `Γ*`)

The bespoke EM truth lemma inducts over a countable formula family `Γ*` that is closed under
subformulas, countable-connective components, existential Skolem-witness instances, and the
template renamings. This file provides the **language-agnostic** staged-closure machinery — closing
a seed set `Γ₀` under a pointwise expansion `stepOne : α → Set α` via explicit stages (no
impredicative least-closure) — together with countability and the consumer-facing closure lemma.

The concrete formula `stepOne` (subformulas / components / Skolem witnesses / renamings) inside
`skolemColim L` is layered on top in a later chunk; `Γ*` will be `setClosure` of that step applied
to the lifted EM starting family.

successor adds `stepOne x` for every `x` already present. Increasing by construction. -/

/-- **Closure property** (consumer-facing): the expansion of any member stays in the closure. If
`x ∈ Γ*` then `stepOne x ⊆ Γ*`. -/

/-- Immediate subformulas and countable-connective components of a formula, over **any** language:

variable (L : Language.{0, 0})

abbrev ColimFormula := Σ n, (skolemColim L).BoundedFormulaω Empty n

/-- A formula tagged with the finite language **stage** at which it lives. The closure works at
this staged level — so the existential-witness Skolem term is directly available at the next stage
— and projects to a colimit formula only via `toColimFormula`. This avoids ever inverting the
colimit quotient. -/
abbrev SkFormula := Σ k : ℕ, Σ n : ℕ, (skolemStage L k).BoundedFormulaω Empty n

/-- Project a staged formula to a colimit-language formula, transporting along the stage inclusion
`skolemStageInclusion L k`. `Γ*` in the colimit language is the image of the staged closure under
this map. -/

  | ⟨k, n, φ⟩ => ⟨n, φ.mapLanguage (skolemStageInclusion L k)⟩

formula, keeping the stage `k` fixed. -/

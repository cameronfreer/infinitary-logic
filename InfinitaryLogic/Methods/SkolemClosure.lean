# Staged set-closure (generic core for the Skolem-closed family `Γ*`)

The bespoke EM truth lemma inducts over a countable formula family `Γ*` that is closed under
subformulas, countable-connective components, existential Skolem-witness instances, and the
template renamings. This file provides the **language-agnostic** staged-closure machinery — closing
a seed set `Γ₀` under a pointwise expansion `stepOne : α → Set α` via explicit stages (no
impredicative least-closure) — together with countability and the consumer-facing closure lemma.

The concrete formula `stepOne` (subformulas / components / Skolem witnesses / renamings) inside
`skolemColim L` is layered on top in a later chunk; `Γ*` will be `setClosure` of that step applied
to the lifted EM starting family.

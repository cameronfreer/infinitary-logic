# The finite-arity Erdős–Rado residual (bounded color cardinal, `ω₁` output)

The ER-facing residual that discharges the Morley–Hanf pure-coloring hypothesis
(`pureColoringHypothesis_of_finiteArityErdosRadoOmega1` in `Conditional/MorleyHanfTransfer.lean`):
for every well-ordered source of size `≥ ℶ_{ω₁}` and every per-arity coloring family with color
types of size `≤ κ`, there is **one** `ω₁`-suborder homogeneous for all arities simultaneously.

Two design constraints, learned the hard way, dictate the shape:

* **Bounded color cardinal, not `Bool`.** Packing the countably many `Bool` colorings of a fixed
  arity into a single coloring produces a `ℕ → Bool` color — continuum many colors — so a
  `Bool`-only (or `ℵ₀`-color) pair theorem cannot serve the family through packing. The residual
  therefore takes an arbitrary color bound `κ`; the Morley–Hanf discharge uses `κ := ℶ_1`.
* **One output suborder for all arities.** Iterating a single-arity theorem over the countable
  family fails: after one pass the source has shrunk to an `ω₁`-suborder, which is far too small
  to feed the next pass (each pass consumes a `ℶ`-sized source). The homogenization across
  arities must happen inside the (per-arity, finitely iterated) construction, with the countable
  same-arity family packed into one large color.

The classical proof target: for each arity `n + 1`, Erdős–Rado gives
`(ℶ_n(κ))^+ → (κ^+)^{n+1}_κ`-style homogenization; the source `ℶ_{ω₁}` dominates every finite
stage, and the per-arity outputs are intersected/diagonalized along a single `ω₁`-suborder. The
first hard sub-chunk is the pair case with parameterized colors
(`#C ≤ κ`, `#I ≥ (2^κ)⁺` ⇒ a `κ⁺`-suborder pair-homogeneous), of which the legacy
`Bool`/`ℵ₀` pair theorem is the specialization.

/-! ## The residual -/

/-- **The finite-arity Erdős–Rado residual with color bound `κ`**: for every well-ordered source
`I` of size `≥ ℶ_{ω₁}` and every family of per-arity colorings `c n : (Fin n ↪o I) → C n` with
`#(C n) ≤ κ`, there is a single `ω₁`-suborder of `I` homogeneous for **all** arities
simultaneously.

This is the exact interface the Morley–Hanf chain consumes at `κ := ℶ_1`
(`pureColoringHypothesis_of_finiteArityErdosRadoOmega1`): the countably many `Bool` colorings of
each arity pack into one color type `{i // arity i = n} → Bool` of size `≤ 2^{ℵ₀} = ℶ_1`. The
color bound must be a parameter — a `Bool`-only statement cannot absorb the packing, and
iterating a one-coloring theorem over the family dies after one pass (the output `ω₁`-suborder
is too small to source the next). -/

# Polarity of relation-symbol occurrences (issue #14, Unit 0 layer 1)

The signed occurrence traversal underlying Lyndon interpolation: `relationsInSigned s φ` collects
the relation symbols occurring in `φ` with sign `s`, where

* an **antecedent flips** the sign (`imp`);
* `all`, `iInf`, `iSup` **preserve** it;
* **equality is logical** — it contributes to neither sign.

`positiveRelationsIn` and `negativeRelationsIn` are the two instances.  Negation needs no clause of
its own: `φ.not = φ.imp ⊥`, so the swap laws
`positiveRelationsIn φ.not = negativeRelationsIn φ` and its dual fall out of the `imp` clause, and
the same computation gives `and`, `or`, `ex`, `⊤`, `einf`, `esup`.

This file is deliberately **syntax only** and sits in the `Lomega1omega` layer: it mentions no
occurrence machinery from `Methods/` (in particular not `relationsIn`, `baseRelationsIn`, or the
constant-expansion calculus).  The bridge `relationsIn = positive ∪ negative` and the signed twins
of the `Methods`-level calculus live in `Methods/PolarityCalculus.lean`.

## Simp discipline

Only the **generic** `relationsInSigned` equations are `@[simp]`; the `positiveRelationsIn` /
`negativeRelationsIn` forms are reducible abbreviations of those, so no derived rewrite is
installed alongside them and nothing can loop through `not`, `and`, `or`, or `ex`.

/-- **The signed occurrence traversal.**  `relationsInSigned true φ` is the set of relation
symbols with a positive occurrence in `φ`, and `relationsInSigned false φ` those with a negative
occurrence: antecedents flip the sign, quantifiers and the countable connectives preserve it, and
equality contributes nothing. -/

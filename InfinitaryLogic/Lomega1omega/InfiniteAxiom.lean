# The infiniteness axiom of `L_ω₁ω`

`L_ω₁ω` defines infiniteness, which first-order logic cannot: `infiniteAxiom` is the countable
conjunction of Mathlib's finitary "there are at least `n` elements" sentences, embedded along
`Sentence.toLω`, and `realize_infiniteAxiom` says a nonempty structure realizes it exactly when
its carrier is infinite.

This is the standard device for restricting attention to infinite models — in particular for
transferring a statement about **coded** countable structures (whose carrier is `ℕ`, hence
infinite) to a statement about arbitrary models of a sentence, where a finite model would
otherwise escape.

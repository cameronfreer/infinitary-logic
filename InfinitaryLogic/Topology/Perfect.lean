# Cardinality of perfect sets

A nonempty perfect subset of a complete, second-countable metric space has cardinality exactly
continuum (`Perfect.mk_eq_continuum`).  The hypotheses are purely topological; no logic is
involved.

Second countability enters only through the upper bound.  The lower bound is
`Perfect.exists_nat_bool_injection`, which needs only `MetricSpace` + `CompleteSpace`.

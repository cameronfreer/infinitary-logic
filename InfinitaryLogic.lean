# Infinitary Logic

This library formalizes infinitary logic, including:
- L∞ω: Infinitary logic with arbitrary conjunctions/disjunctions
- Lω₁ω: Countable infinitary logic (countable conjunctions/disjunctions)
- Scott sentences and Scott rank for characterizing countable structures

## Main Results

- Every countable structure in a relational countable language has a Scott sentence
  that characterizes it up to isomorphism.
- The Scott rank of a countable structure is a countable ordinal (< ω₁).
- L∞ω is the union of all Lκω for cardinals κ; Lω₁ω = L(ℵ₁)ω.

The unconditional API is recovered via `countableRefinementHypothesis` (proved in
`Scott/RefinementCount.lean`). Conditional `_of` variants taking
`CountableRefinementHypothesis` as a hypothesis are also available.
